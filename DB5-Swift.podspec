                   App Configuration via Plist.

                   * By storing colors, fonts, numbers, booleans, and so on in a plist, we were able to iterate quickly on our app Vesper.
                   Our designers could easily make changes without having to dive into the code or ask engineering to spend time nudging
                   pixels and changing values.There is nothing magical about the code or the system: itâ€™s some simple code plus a few conventions.
